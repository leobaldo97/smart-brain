In this "Smart Brain" project, I developed a face recognition software using a pre-existing image recognition API by "Clarifai".

The frontend was built using React.js while backend using Node.js and Express.js. Each user has its own profile where the counter of face detections is updated as long as new faces are detected in the URL images uploaded. Consequently, this full-stack project involved also database and server components to keep the data updated about faces counter and users' login data.

By opening the project folder, you will find a README with instructions for launching the web app from the terminal.
